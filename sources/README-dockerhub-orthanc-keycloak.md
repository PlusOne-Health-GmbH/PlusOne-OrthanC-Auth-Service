# Orthanc-keycloak

Override of Keycloak official image to have these elements ready to use:
- realm (`orthanc` and `master`)
- client (`orthanc`)
- 2 sample users (`orthanc` and `doctor`, passwords are identical to usernames)
- 2 sample roles (`admin` and `doctor`)
- Orthanc logo on the login page

The `master` realm has an `admin` user with the `admin` password.

3 demo setups are available [here](https://github.com/orthanc-team/orthanc-auth-service/tree/main/minimal-setup).
